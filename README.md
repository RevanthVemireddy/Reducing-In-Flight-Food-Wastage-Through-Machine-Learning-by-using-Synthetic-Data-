## Overview

This repository houses a comprehensive analysis of flight data using synthetic datasets and machine learning models. The project is divided into two main parts: the creation of a synthetic dataset and the application of a Linear Regression model to predict and analyze flight-related data. This setup provides a hands-on experience for data scientists and enthusiasts looking to understand the application of machine learning in optimizing flight operations.

## Files

1. Synthetic data creation - Flight data 100k rows.ipynb
   - This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code used to generate synthetic flight data. It simulates realistic flight information and passenger behavior to create a dataset that mirrors true operational complexities without using real passenger data.
   
2. synthetic_flight_data.csv
   - A CSV file generated by the first notebook. It contains 100,000 rows of synthetic data representing flight details such as flight IDs, departure and arrival times, meal preferences, and passenger numbers.

3. Final Algorithm.ipynb
   - A Jupyter Notebook that imports the synthetic flight data from the CSV file and applies a Linear Regression model. This notebook focuses on predicting meal requirements for flights to minimize wastage, showcasing the utility of data-driven decision-making in the airline industry.

## Usage

To run the notebooks effectively, ensure you have Jupyter installed on your system, or use an online platform that supports Jupyter Notebooks like Google Colab or IBM Watson Studio. The data file must be in the same directory as the notebooks for the paths to align correctly, or you may need to adjust the file path in the code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
