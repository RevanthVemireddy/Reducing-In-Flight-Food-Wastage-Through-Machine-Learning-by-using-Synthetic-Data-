    "* Create varying Flight_Duration (units: hours) , based on the travel distance between origin and destination airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flight_Time hs to be consistent, There are usually morning, afternoon, evening, night & early hour flights with their own fixed timings. I want you to allocate such fixed timings to each flight\n",
    "\n",
    "* The randomly generated dates should cover the entire 2023 & 2022 calendar years, allocate flights accordingly per month.\n",

If a certain month falls under monsoon season, that time frame is likely to experience more bad weather. Similarly if a certain date or month falls under summer, flights in that time frame are less likely to experience bad weather.\n",

    "* Jain_Food has to be high if there's a Jain Festival\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Flights early in the morning or late at night might have different meal consumption patterns compared to midday flights. Similarly, weekdays vs. weekends or holiday seasons could affect passenger numbers and meal consumption.\n",
